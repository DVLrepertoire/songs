# Inch by Inch, Row by Row

Inch by inch, row by row  
Gonna make this garden grow  
All you need is a rake and a hoe  
And a piece of fertile ground  
Inch by inch, row by row  
Someone bless these seeds I sow  
Someone warm them from below  
Till the rain comes tumbling down  

Pulling weeds, picking stones  
We are made of dreams and bones  
Need a place to call my own  
For the time is close at hand  
Grain for grain, sun and rain  
Find my way through nature's chain  
Tune my body and my brain  
To the music of the land  

Chorus  

Plant your rows straight and long  
Temper them with prayer and song  
Mother Earth will make you strong  
If you give her love and care  
Old crow watching hungrily  
From his perch in yonder tree  
In my garden Iâ€™m as free  
As that feathered thief up there  

Chorus  

*Dave Mallet*
