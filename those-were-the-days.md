# Those Were the Days

Once upon a time there was a tavern  
Where we used to raise a glass or two  
Remember how we laughed away the hours  
And dreamed of all the great things  
we would do  

Those were the days my friend,  
We'd thought they'd never end  
We'd sing and dance forever and a day  
We'd live the life we choose,  
We'd fight and never lose  
For we were young and  
sure to have our way  

Then the busy years went rushing by us  
We lost our starry notions on the way  
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern  
We'd smile at one another and we'd say  

**Chorus**  

Just tonight I stood before the tavern  
Nothing seemed the way it used to be  
In the glass I saw a strange reflection  
Was that lonely person really me  

**Chorus**  

Through the door there came familiar laughter  
I saw your face and heard you call my name  
Oh, my friend, we're older but no wiser  
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same  

**Chorus**  

La la la la la la, la-la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la la la la  
Those were the days, oh yes, those were the days  

*Gene Raskin, 1962 — based on a Russian folk song*
