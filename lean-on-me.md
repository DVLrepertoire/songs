# Lean On Me

Lean on me,  
when you're not strong  
And I'll be your friend  
I'll help you carry on  
For it won't be long  
'Til I'm gonna need  
Somebody to lean on  

Sometimes in our lives  
we all have pain  
We all have sorrow  
But if we are wise  
We know that  
there's always tomorrow  

**Chorus**  

Please swallow your pride  
If I have things  
you need to borrow  
For no one can fill  
those of your needs  
That you don't let show  

**Chorus**  

You just call on me brother,  
when you need a hand  
We all need  
somebody to lean on  
I might just have a problem  
that you'll understand  
We all need  
somebody to lean on  

**Chorus**  

If there is a load  
you have to bear  
That you can't carry  
I'm right up the road  
I'll share your load  
If you just call me  

**Chorus**  

*Bill Withers*
