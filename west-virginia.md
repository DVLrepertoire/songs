# West Virginia

Almost heaven, West Virginia  
Blue Ridge Mountains,  
Shenandoah River  
Life is old there, older than the trees  
Younger than the mountains,  
Blowing like a breeze  

Country Roads, Take me home  
To the place I belong  
West Virginia, Mountain Momma  
Take me home, Country Roads  

All my memories gather round her  
Miner's Lady, Stranger to blue water  
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky  
Misty taste of moonshine,  
Teardrop in my eye  

Country Roads, Take me home  
To the place I belong  
West Virginia, Mountain Momma  
Take me home, Country Roads  

I hear her voice  
In the morning hours she calls me  
The radio reminds me  
Of my home far away  
In driving down the road I get a feeling  
That I shoulda been home  
yesterday, yesterday  

Country Roads, take me home  
To the place I belong  
West Virginia, Mountain Momma  
Take me home, Country Roads  

Country Roads, take me home  
To the place I belong  
West Virginia, Mountain Momma  
Take me home, Country Roads
