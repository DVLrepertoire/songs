# Blowing In The Wind

{start_of_verse}
[G]How many [C]roads must a [D]man walk [G]down,
before you [C]call him a [G]man
[G]How many [C]seas must a [D]white dove [G]sail,
before she [C]sleeps in the [D]sand
Yes, and [G]how many [C]times must the [D]cannonballs [G]fly,
before they're [C]forever [G]banned
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[C]The answer my [D]friend is [G]blowin' in the [C]wind
The answer is [D]blowin' in the [G]wind
{end_of_chorus}




{start_of_verse}
Yes, and [G]how many [C]years can a [D]mountain e[G]xist,
before it is [C]washed to the [G]sea
Yes, and [G]how many [C]years can some [D]people [G]exist,
before they're [C]allowed to be [D]free
Yes, and [G]how many [C]times can a [D]man turn his [G]head,
and pretend that he j[C]ust doesn't [G]see
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[C]The answer my [D]friend is [G]blowin' in the [C]wind
The answer is [D]blowin' in the [G]wind
{end_of_chorus}




{start_of_verse}
Yes, and [G]how many [C]times must a [D]man look [G]up,
before he can [C]see the [G]sky
Yes, and [G]how many [C]ears must [D]one man [G]have,
before he can [C]hear people [D]cry
Yes, and [G]how many [C]deaths will it [D]take till he [G]knows,
that too many [C]people have [G]died
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[C]The answer my [D]friend is [G]blowin' in the [C]wind
The answer is [D]blowin' in the [G]wind
{end_of_chorus}
