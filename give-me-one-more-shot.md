# Give Me One More Shot

Life ain't all that easy, I can testify to that  
It's been up and down and round and round  
to get to where I'm at  
If you could see how I'm living  
in this old car I drive  
Well you'd probably wonder and even ponder why I even wanna stay alive  

So give me one more shot,  
I'll give it all I've got  
"Let me open my eyes to a new sunrise", I pray  
Give me one more chance,  
I'll learn to dance the dance  
I'm satisfied just being alive,  
give me one more day  

I could complain about taxes  
or the weather we're having today  
Go on and on about things that are wrong from New York to L.A.  
Well that's just not my nature  
to sit around feeling sad  
We're only here for awhile so why not smile hey, living ain't all that bad  

Chorus  

When I look around there's lots of folks  
worse off than me  
So I just thank the good Lord  
and ask Him please  

Give me one more shot  
I'll give it all I've got  
"Let me open my eyes to a new sunrise", I pray  
And give me one more chance,  
I'll learn to dance the dance  
Well I'm satisfied just being alive,  
give me one more day  
I'm satisfied just being alive,  
give me one more day  

Give me one more shot,  
I'll give it all I've got  
Give me one more day  
Show me the way  
and give me one more day  
Give me one more shot
