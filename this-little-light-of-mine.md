# This Little Light of Mine

This little light of mine,  
I'm gonna let it shine.  
This little light of mine,  
I'm gonna let it shine.  
This little light of mine,  
I'm gonna let it shine.  
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine  

Light that shines is the light of love,  
Hides the darkness from above,  
Shines on me and it shines on you,  
Shows what the power of love can do.  
Shine my light both bright and clear,  
Shine my light both far and near,  
In every dark corner that I find,  
Gonna let my little light shine.  

Chorus  

Sunday gave me the gift of love,  
Monday peace came from above,  
Tuesday He told me to have more faith,  
Wednesday He gave me a little more grace,  
Thursday He told me to watch and pray,  
Friday He told me just what to say  
Saturday He gave me the power divine  
Just to let my little light shine.  

Chorus  

*Spiritual*
