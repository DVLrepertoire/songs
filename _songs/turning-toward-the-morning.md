# Turning Toward the Morning

When the deer has bedded down  
And the bear has gone to ground  
And the northern goose has wandered off  
To warmer bay and sound  
It's so easy in the cold to feel  
The darkness of the year  
And the heart is growing lonely  
For the morning  
  
**Chorus:**  
Oh, my Joanie, don't you know  
That the stars are swinging slow  
And the seas are rolling easy  
As they did so long ago?  
If I had a thing to give you  
I would tell you one more time  
That the world is always turning  
Toward the morning  
  
Now October's growing thin  
And November's coming home;  
You'll be thinking of the season  
And the sad things that you've seen  
And you hear that old wind walking  
Hear him singing high and thin  
You could swear he's out there singing  
Of your sorrow  
  
**Chorus**  
 
When the darkness falls around you  
And the Northwind come to blow  
And you hear him call your name out  
As he walks the brittle snow:  
That old wind don't mean you trouble  
He don't care or even know  
He's just walking down the darkness  
Toward the morning  
  
**Chorus**  
  
It's a pity we don't know  
What the little flowers know  
They can't face the cold November  
They can't take the wind and snow:  
They put their glories all behind them  
Bow their heads and let it go  
But you know they'll be there shining  
In the morning  
  
**Chorus**  
  
Now, my Joanie, don't you know  
That the days are rolling slow  
And the winter's walking easy  
As he did so long ago?  
And, if that wind would should and ask you  
"Why's my Joanie weeping so?"  
Won't you tell him that you're weeping  
For the morning?  
  
**Chorus**
