# MTA Song

Now let me tell you a story  
‘bout a man named Charlie  
On that tragic and fateful day  
He put ten cents in his pocket,  
kissed his wife and family  
Went to ride on the MTA.  

But did he ever return?  
No, he never returned  
And his fate is still unlearned  
He may ride forever  
‘neath the streets of Boston  
He’s the man who never returned.  

Charlie handed in his dime  
at the Kendall Square Station  
And he changed for Jamaica Plain  
When he got there the conductor told him “One more nickel”  
Charlie couldn’t get off that train.  

Now all night long  
Charlie rides through the tunnel  
Saying “What will become of me?  
How can I afford to see my sister in Chelsea  
Or my cousin in Roxbury?”  

Charlie’s wife goes down  
to the Scollay Square Station  
Every day at a quarter past two  
And through the open window  
she hands Charlie a sandwich  
As the train comes rumblin’ through.  

Now you citizens of Boston,  
don’t you think it is a scandal  
That the people have to pay and pay?  
Fight the fare increase,  
vote for Walter O’Brien  
Get Charlie off the MTA.
