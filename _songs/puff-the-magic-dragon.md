# Puff, The Magic Dragon

Puff, the magic dragon, lived by the sea  
And frolicked in the autumn mist  
in a land called Honalee.  
Little Jackie Paper loved that rascal Puff  
And brought him strings and sealing wax  
and other fancy stuff, oh  

Puff, the magic dragon, lived by the sea  
And frolicked in the autumn mist  
in a land called Honalee.  
Puff, the magic dragon, lived by the sea  
And frolicked in the autumn mist  

in a land called Honalee.  
Together they would travel  
on boat with billowed sail  
Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff's gigantic tail  
Noble kings and princes  
would bow whene'er they came  
Pirate ships would lower their flags  
when Puff roared out his name, oh  

Puff, the magic dragon, lived . . .  

A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys  
Painted wings and giantâ€™s rings  
make way for other toys.  
One grey night it happened,  
Jackie Paper came no more  
And Puff that mighty dragon,  
he ceased his fearless roar.  

His head was bent in sorrow,  
green scales fell like rain  
Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane.  
Without his lifelong friend, Puff could not be brave  
So, Puff that mighty dragon  
sadly slipped into his cave, oh  

Puff, the magic dragon, lived . . .
