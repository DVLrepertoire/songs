# A Place In The Choir

Chorus:

{start_of_chorus}
[G]All God's creatures got a place in the choir
[D]Some sing low and [G]some sing higher
Some [C]sing out loud on the [G]telephone wire
[D]Some just clap their [G]hands or paws, or anything they got now
{end_of_chorus}



{start_of_verse}
[G]Listen to the bass, it's the one on the bottom
Where the [D]bullfrog croaks and the [G]hippopotamus
[C]Moans and groans with a [G]big to do
And the [D]old cow just goes [G]moo
{end_of_verse}

Chorus

{start_of_verse}
[G]Dogs and the cats they take up the middle
While the [D]honeybee hums and the [G]cricket fiddles
The [C]donkey brays and the [G]pony neighs
And the [D]old grey badger [G]sighs
{end_of_verse}

Chorus

{start_of_verse}
[G]Listen to the top where the little bird sings
On the [D]melodies and the [G]high notes ringing
And the [C]hoot owl cries over [G]everything
And the [D]blackbird disa[G]grees
{end_of_verse}

Chorus

{start_of_verse}
[G]Singin' in the night time, singin' in the day
When the [D]little duck quacks and he's [G]on his way
And the [C]otter hasn't got [G]much to say
And the [D]porcupine talks to him[G]self
{end_of_verse}

Chorus

{start_of_verse}
It's a [G]simple song of livin' sung everywhere
By the [D]ox and the fox and the [G]grizzly bear
The [C]grumpy alligator and the the [G]hawk above
The sly rac[D]coon and the [G]turtle dove
{end_of_verse}
