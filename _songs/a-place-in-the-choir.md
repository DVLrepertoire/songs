# A Place In The Choir

**Chorus:**  
All God's critters got a place in the choir  
Some sing low, some sing higher,  
Some sing out loud on the telephone wire,  
And some just clap their hands, or paws,  
or anything they got now  

Listen to the bass, it's the one on the bottom  
Where the bullfrog croaks and the hippopotamus  
Moans and groans with a big t'do  
The old cow just goes moo.  

**Chorus**  

The dogs and the cats they take up the middle  
The hummingbird hums and the cricket fiddles,  
The donkey brays and the pony neighs  
And the old coyote howls.  

**Chorus**  

Listen to the top where the little birds sing  
On the melody with the high notes ringing,  
The hoot owl hollers over everything  
And the jay bird disagrees.  

**Chorus**  

Singin' in the night time, singing in the day,  
The little duck quacks, and he's on his way.  
The 'possum ain't got much to say  
And the porcupine talks to himself.  

**Chorus**  

It's a simple song of living sung everywhere  
By the ox and the fox and the grizzly gear,  
The grumpy alligator the hawk above,  
The sly raccoon and the turtle dove.  

**Chorus**
