# River

I was born in the path of the winter wind  
I was raised where the mountains are old  
Their springtime waters came dancing down  
And I remember the tales they told  

The whistling ways of my younger days  
Too quickly have faded on by  
But all of their memories linger on  
Like the light in a fading sky  

**Chorus:**  
River, take me along in your sunshine, sing me a song  
Ever moving and winding and free  
You rolling old river,  
you changing old river  
Let's you and me, river,  
run down to the sea  

I've been to the city and back again  
I've been moved by some things that I've learned  
Met a lot of good people and  
I've called them friends  
Felt the change when the seasons turned  

I've heard all the songs that the children sing  
And listened to love's melodies  
I've felt my own music within me rise  
Like the wind in the autumn trees  

**Chorus**  

Someday when the flowers are blooming still  
Someday when the grass is still green  
My rolling waters will round the bend  
And flow into the open sea  

So, here's to the rainbow  
that's followed me here  
And here's to the friends that I know  
And here's to the song that's within me now  
I will sing it wherever I go  

**Chorus**  

*Bill Staines*
