# Rambling Boy

He was a man and a friend always  
We rambled round in the hard ol' days  
He never cared if I had no dough  
We rambled round in the rain and snow  

So here's to you my ramblin' boy  
May all your ramblin’ bring you joy  
So here's to you my ramblin' boy  
May all your ramblin’ bring you joy  

In Tulsa town we chanced to stray  
We thought we'd try to work one day  
The boss says he had room for one  
Says my old pal, "We'd rather bum"  

Late one night in a jungle camp  
The weather it was cold and damp  
He got the chills, and he got them bad  
They took the only friend I had  

He left me here to ramble on  
My ramblin' pal is dead and gone  
If when we die we go somewhere  
I'll bet you a dollar he's ramblin' there
