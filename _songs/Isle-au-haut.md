# Isle Au Haut Lullaby

If I could give you three things,  
I would give you these:  
Song and laughter and a wooden home  
In the shining seas  

**Chorus:**  
When you see old Isle au Haut  
Rising in the dawn,  
You will play in yellow fields  
In the morning sun.  

Sleep where the wind is warm  
And the moon is high.  
Give sadness to the stars,  
Sorrow to the sky.  

**Chorus**  

Do you hear what the sails are saying  
In the windâ€™s dark song?  
Give sadness to the wind,  
Blown alee and gone.  

**Chorus**  

Sleep now, the moon is high,  
And the wind blows cold;  
For you are sad and young  
And the sea is old.  

**Chorus**  

If I could give you three things  
I would give you these:  
Song and laughter and a wooden home  
In the shining seas.  

**Chorus**  

*Gordon Bok*
