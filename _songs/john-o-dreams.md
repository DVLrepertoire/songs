# John O' Dreams  

When midnight comes  
Good people homeward tread  
Seek now your blankets  
And your feather bed  
Home comes the rover  
His journey's over  
Yield up the nighttime  
To old John O'Dreams  
Yield up the nighttime  
To old John O'Dreams  
  
Across the hill  
The sun has gone astray  
Tomorrow's cares  
Are many dreams away  
The stars are glowing  
Your candle's dying  
Yield up the darkness  
To old John O'Dreams  
Yield up the darkness  
To old John O'Dreams  
  
Both man and master  
In the night are one  
All things are equal  
When the day is done  
The prince and ploughman  
The slave and freeman  
All find their comfort  
In old John O'Dreams  
All find their comfort  
In old John O'Dreams  
See upcoming country shows  
Get tickets for your favorite artists  
  
Now as you sleep  
Your dreams going in clear  
The hawks of morning  
Cannot harm you here  
Sleep is your river  
Float on forever  
And for your boatman  
Choose old John O'Dreams  
And for your boatman  
Choose old John O'Dreams
