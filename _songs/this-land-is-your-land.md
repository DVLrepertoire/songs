# This Land Is Your Land

**Chorus:**  
This land is your land  
This land is my land  
From California to the New York island;  
From the red wood forest  
to the Gulf Stream waters  
This land was made for you and me.  

As I was walking that ribbon of highway,  
I saw above me that endless skyway:  
I saw below me that golden valley:  
This land was made for you and me.  

**Chorus**  

I've roamed and rambled  
and I followed my footsteps  
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts;  
And all around me a voice was sounding:  
This land was made for you and me.  

**Chorus**  

When the sun came shining,  
and I was strolling,  
And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling,  
As the fog was lifting a voice was chanting:  
This land was made for you and me.  

**Chorus**  

As I went walking I saw a sign there  
And on the sign it said "No Trespassing."  
But on the other side it didn't say nothing,  
That side was made for you and me.  

**Chorus**  

Nobody living can ever stop me,  
As I go walking that freedom highway;  
Nobody living can ever make me turn back  
This land was made for you and me.  

**Chorus**  

*Woody Guthrie*
