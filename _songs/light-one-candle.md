# Light One Candle

Light one candle for the Maccabees' children  
With thanks that their light didn't die  
Light one candle for the pain they endured  
When their right to exist was denied  
Light one candle for the terrible sacrifice  
Justice and freedom demand  
But light one candle for the wisdom to know  
When the peacemaker's time is at hand  

**Chorus:**  
Don't let the light go out  
It's lasted for so many years  
Don't let the light go out  
Let it shine through our love and our tears  

Light one candle for the strength that we need  
To never become our own foe  
And light one candle  
for those who are suffering  
Pain we learned so long ago  
Light one candle for all we believe in  
That anger not tear us apart  
And light one candle to find us together  
With peace as the song in our hearts  

**Chorus**  

What is the memory that's valued so highly  
That we keep it alive in that flame?  
What's the commitment  
to those who have died  
That we cry out they've not died in vain?  
We have come this far always believing  
That justice would somehow prevail  
This is the burden, this is the promise  
This is why we will not fail  

**Chorus**  

*Peter Yarrow*
