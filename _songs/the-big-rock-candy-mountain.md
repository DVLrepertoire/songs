# The Big Rock Candy Mountain

On a summer's day in the month of May  
A burly bum came a-hikin'.  
Through a shady lane in the sugar cane  
He was lookin' for his likin'.  
As he strolled along, he sang a song  
Of a land of milk and honey,  
Where a bum can stay for many a day  
And you don't need any money.  

Oh, the buzzing of the bees  
in the cigarette trees,  
By the soda water fountain  
Near the lemonade springs  
where the bluebird sings  
On the Big Rock Candy Mountain  

In the Big Rock Candy Mountain  
The cops have wooden legs  
The bulldogs all have rubber teeth  
And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs  
The box-cars all are empty  
And the sun shines every day  
I'm bound to go where there ain't no snow  
Where the sleet don't fall  
and the winds don't blow  
In the Big Rock Candy Mountain.  

In the Big Rock Candy Mountain  
You never change your socks  
And little streams of alky-hol  
Come trickling down the rocks  
O the shacks all have to tip their hats  
And the railway bulls are blind  
There's a lake of stew and ginger ale too  
And you can paddle  
all around it in a big canoe  
In the Big Rock Candy Mountain
