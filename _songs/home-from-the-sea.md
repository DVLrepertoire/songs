# Home From The Sea

On a cold winter night  
With a storm at its height  
The lifeboat answered the call  
They pitched and they tossed  
Till we thought they were lost  
As we watched from the harbor wall  

Though the night was pitch black  
There was no turning back  
For someone was waiting out there  
But each volunteer  
Had to live with his fear  
As they joined in a silent prayer  

And carry them  
Home, home, home from the sea  
Angels of mercy, answer our plea  
And carry us  
Home, home, home from the sea  
Carry us safely, home from the sea  

As they battled their way  
Past the mouth of the bay  
It was blowing like never before  
As they gallantly fought  
Every one of them thought  
Of loved ones back on the shore  

Then a flicker of light  
And they knew they were right  
There she was on the crest of a wave  
She's an old fishing boat  
And she's barely afloat  
Please God, there are souls we can save  

Chorus  

And back in the town  
In a street that runs down  
To the sea and the harbor wall  
They'd gathered in pairs  
At the foot of the stairs  
To wait for the radio call  
And just before dawn  
When all hope was gone  
Came hush and a faraway sound  
'Twas the coxswain he roared  
All survivors on board  
Thank God and we're homeward bound  

Chorus 2X
