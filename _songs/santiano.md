We're sailing 'cross the river from Liverpool  
Heave aweigh, Santiano  
'Round Cape Horn to Frisco Bay  
Way out in Californ-i-o  

**Chorus:**  
So, heave her up and away we'll go  
Heave aweigh, Santiano  
So, heave her up and away we'll go  
Way out in Californ-i-o  

There's plenty of gold, so I've been told  
Heave aweigh, Santiano  
There's plenty of gold, so I've been told  
Way out in Californ-i-o  

**Chorus**  

Well, back in the days of forty-nine  
Heave aweigh, Santiano  
Back in the days of the good old times  
Way out in Californ-i-o  

**Chorus**  

When I leave ship, I'll settle down  
Heave aweigh, Santiano  
Marry a girl named Sally Brown  
Way out in Californi-i-o  

**Chorus**  

*Antonio Berardi, Hartmut Krech, Mark Nissen, Lukas Hainer*
