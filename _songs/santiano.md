# Santiano
Farewell now my love, send me off with a kiss  
Heave away, straight ahead, Santiano  
The tears are as salty and deep as the sea  
But my sailor′s heart is keen to go  

As far the wind in our sails may blow  
Heave away, straight ahead, Santiano  
Bribe the day and the heavens know  
We'll be kings wherever we may go  
  
Hoist every bit of sail, bring us to full speed  
Heave away, straight ahead, Santiano  
Who knows what our fate may be?  
But the whole wide world is ours to see  
  
I'm fine without a roof and a house of stone  
Heave away, straight ahead, Santiano  
Home for me is the sea we roam  
And the roof of stars is mine alone (hey)  
  
Farewell now my love, send me off with a kiss  
Heave away, straight ahead, Santiano  
The tears are as salty and deep as the sea  
But my sailor′s heart is keen to go
