# The Fox

The fox went out on a chilly night  
Prayed for the moon for to give him light  
He had many a mile to go that night  
Before he reached the town-o, town-o, town-o  
He had many a mile to go that night  
Before he reached the town-o.  

He ran till he came to a great big pen  
The ducks and the geese were put therein  
Said, "A couple of you will grease my chin  
Before I leave this town-o," town-o, town-o  
Said, "A couple of you will grease my chin  
Before I leave this town-o."  

He grabbed a grey goose by the neck  
Throwed a duck across his back  
He didn't mind their quack-quack-quack  
And the legs all danglin' down-o, down-o, down-o  
He didn't mind their quack-quack-quack  
And the legs all danglin' down-o.  

Old Mother Flipperflopper jumped out of bed  
Out of the window she popped her head  
Cryin', "John, John, the grey goose is gone  
And the fox is on the town-o, town-o, town-o  
John, John, the grey goose is gone  
And the fox is on the town-o!"  

John, he ran to the top of the hill  
Blew his horn both loud and shrill  
The fox he said, "I better flee with my kill  
Or they'll soon be on my trail-o, trail-o, trail-o  
I better flee with my kill  
Or they'll soon be on my trail-o."  

He ran till he came to his cozy den  
There were the little ones, eight, nine, ten  
Sayin', "Daddy, Daddy, better go back again  
'Cause it must be a mighty fine town-o, town-o, town-o  
Daddy, Daddy, go back again  
For it must be a mighty fine town-o."
