# Drunken Sailor

What will we do with a drunken sailor?  
What will we do with a drunken sailor?  
What will we do with a drunken sailor?  
Early in the morning  

Chorus  

Hoo-ray and up she rises  
Hoo-ray and up she rises  
Hoo-ray and up she rises  
Early in the morning  

Put him in a long boat till he's sober  
Put him in a long boat till he's sober  
Put him in a long boat till he's sober  
Early in the morning  

Shave his belly with a rusty razor  
Shave his belly with a rusty razor  
Shave his belly with a rusty razor  
Early in the morning  

Stick him in a scupper with a hosepipe bottom  
Stick him in a scupper with a hosepipe bottom  
Stick him in a scupper with a hosepipe bottom  
Early in the morning  

That's what we do with a drunken sailor  
That's what we do with a drunken sailor  
That's what we do with a drunken sailor  
Early in the morning
