# This Little Light of Mine

**Chorus:**  
This little light of mine,  
I'm gonna let it shine.  
This little light of mine,  
I'm gonna let it shine.  
This little light of mine,  
I'm gonna let it shine.  
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine  

Light that shines is the light of love,  
Hides the darkness from above,  
Shines on me and it shines on you,  
Shows what the power of love can do.  
Shine my light both bright and clear,  
Shine my light both far and near,  
In every dark corner that I find,  
Gonna let my little light shine.  

**Chorus**  

Monday He gave me the gift of love,  
Tuesday peace came from above,  
Wednesday He told me to have more faith,  
Thursday He gave me a little more grace,  
Friday He told me to watch and pray,  
Saturday He told me just what to say  
On Sunday He gave me the power divine  
Just to let my little light shine.  

**Chorus**  

*Spiritual*
