# Ha’ Penny Bridge

Come walk with me on the Ha’Penny Bridge  
And sit upon the stairs.  
If old Ma Dublin has a heart,  
I know she keeps it there.  
The feeling there can’t be explained  
Though I’ve tried many times.  
Through smut and smoke and city noise,  
The warm sun always shines.  

On the Ha’Penny Bridge  
you can stand in the sun  
Watching couples stroll by, hand in hand.  
Buy a flower for your love  
from that old woman’s stall,  
With a smile in for free;  
Only you and your love understand.  

An old man sits on the Ha’Penny Bridge  
His music box he plays.  
The people passing stop a while,  
They listen, but don’t pay.  
But he’ll stay there on the Ha’Penny Bridge  
With a soft smile on his face,  
And watch the notes drift on the water  
To some distant place.  

CHORUS  

Each Sunday morning on the bridge  
The children gather there.  
The rich, the poor stand side by side,  
But no one really cares.  
There’s toy balloons and china dolls,  
The stalls stand in a row.  
There’s fruit and flowers and singing birds;  
Buy now before I go.  

CHORUS  

*Makem Brothers*
