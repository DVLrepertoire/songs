# Michael, Row the Boat Ashore

Michael, row the boat ashore, Hallelujah  
Michael, row the boat ashore, Hallelujah  

Sister help to trim the sail, Hallelujah  
Sister help to trim the sail, Hallelujah  

Jordan's river is chilly and cold, Hallelujah  
Chills the body but not the soul, Hallelujah  

Jordan’s river is deep and wide, Hallelujah  
Milk and honey on the other side, Hallelujah  

Michael’s boat is a music boat, Hallelujah  
If you stop singing, then it can’t float, Hallelujah  

Michael, row the boat ashore, Hallelujah  
Michael, row the boat ashore, Hallelujah
