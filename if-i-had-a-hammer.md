# If I Had A Hammer

If I had a hammer,  
I’d hammer in the morning  
I’d hammer in the evening,  
all over this land  
I’d hammer out danger,  
I’d hammer out a warning  
I’d hammer out love between  
my brothers and my sisters  
All over this land  

If I had a bell,  
I’d ring it in the morning  
I’d ring it in the evening,  
all over this land  
I’d ring out danger,  
I’d ring out a warning  
I’d ring out love between  
my brothers and my sisters  
All over this land  

If I had a song,  
I’d sing it in the morning  
I’d sing it in the evening,  
all over this land  
I’d sing out danger,  
I’d sing out a warning  
I’d sing out love between  
my brothers and my sisters  
All over this land  

Well I got a hammer,  
and I got a bell  
And I got a song  
to sing all over this land  
It’s the hammer of justice,  
it’s the bell of freedom  
It’s a song about love between  
my brothers and my sisters  
All over this land  

*Pete Seeger and Lee Hays*
