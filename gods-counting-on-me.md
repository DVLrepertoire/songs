# God’s Counting On Me

When we look and we see  
Things are not what they should be  
God's counting on me  
God's counting on you. (repeat verse)  

Hoping we'll all pull through  
Hoping we'll all pull through  
Me and you  

When there's big problems to be solved  
Let's get everyone involved  
God's counting on me  
God's counting on you. (repeat verse)  

**CHORUS**  

Now don't give up, don't give in  
Workin' together we all can win  
God's counting on me  
God's counting on you. (repeat verse)  

**CHORUS**  

When we sing with younger folks  
We can never give up hope  
God's counting on me  
God's counting on you. (repeat verse)  

**CHORUS**  

Ad lib verses if inspired.  

**CHORUS as needed.**  

What we do now, you and me  
Will affect eternity  
God's counting on me  
God's counting on you. (repeat verse)  

**CHORUS**  

*Pete Seeger and Lorre Wyatt*
